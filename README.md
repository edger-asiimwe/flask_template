This project requires the following tools:

- Python - The programming language used by Flask.
- SQLite - A relational database system for Local Deployment.
- Virtualenv - A tool for creating isolated Python environments.

To get started, install Python on your local computer if you don't have them already. 

## Getting Started

**Step 1. Clone the code into a fresh folder**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/edger-asiimwe/flasky.git
$ cd 
```

**Step 2. Create a Virtual Environment and install Dependencies.**

Create a new Virtual Environment for the project and activate it. If you don't have the `virtualenv` command yet, you can find installation [instructions here](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Learn more about [Virtual Environments](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#virtual-environments).

```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, we need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `requirements.txt`.

```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3: Update environment variables and run the Server.**

Create a new file named `.env` by duplicating `.env.example`. Update the new file with the GitHub credentials. It should look similar to this:

```
# .env file
DATABASE_URL="[INSERT_DATABASE_URL]"
```

Now we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:

```
(venv) $ flask run
```

Open http://localhost:5000 to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and warnings in the console.
